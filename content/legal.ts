## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Nuzzle. Nuzzle is operated by **Little Wonder LLC** ("we," "our," or "us"). Nuzzle is a social community app for dog breed enthusiasts, connecting dog owners through breed-specific feeds, meetups, Dog Spots (dog parks, beaches, and trails), Dog Friendly Places (nearby dog-welcoming businesses), place check-ins, and dog-to-dog social interactions.

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and the choices you have regarding your information. By creating an account or using Nuzzle, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Account and Profile Information

When you register and use Nuzzle, we collect:

- **Name** and **display name**
- **Email address**
- **City / location** (as entered in your profile)
- **Profile photo** (uploaded by you)
- **Authentication data** — when you sign in with Apple or Google, we receive a unique account identifier from the provider and, at your option, your name and email address

### 2.2 Dog Profile Information

For each dog you add to your account, we collect:

- **Dog name**, **breed**, and **age group**
- **Energy level** and **play style**
- **Compatibility preferences** (e.g., good with puppies, large dogs, small dogs)
- **Additional notes** about your dog
- **Dog photo(s)** (uploaded by you)

### 2.3 Content You Post

We collect content you create and share within the app, including:

- **Posts** (Questions, Updates/Stories, Tips, and Meetups), including any text, tags, and up to multiple photos per post
- **Comments** on posts
- **Emoji reactions** to posts
- **Meetup details** and RSVPs
- **Dog interaction logs** — records of dog-to-dog meetings you log (e.g., at Dog Spots or meetups)
- **Place vibes** — short impressions or reviews you leave on a Dog Spot page
- **Community suggestions** — records of Dog Spot communities you have proposed or expressed interest in

### 2.4 Location Information

We request access to your **device's location** in the following situations:

- **Dog Spot check-ins** — to verify that you are near a Dog Spot (dog beach, dog park, trail, or other curated location) when you check in
- **Nearby Dog Spot alerts** — when enabled, the home feed may check your proximity to a nearby Dog Spot and display a check-in prompt if you are close
- **Dog Friendly Places discovery** — the Dog Friendly Places tab uses your location to show nearby dog-welcoming businesses

We do not continuously track your location in the background. Location access is requested on-device only at the moment each of the above actions is triggered. You can revoke location permission at any time via your device settings; doing so will disable proximity-based features.

### 2.5 Usage and Activity Data

We may collect information about how you use the app, including:

- Screens and features accessed
- Breed communities you join or follow
- Posts, comments, and reactions you engage with
- Search queries and applied filters
- Notification interactions

### 2.6 Device and Technical Information

We may automatically collect:

- **Device type** and **operating system version**
- **App version**
- **Crash logs, error reports, and performance data** — collected through Sentry to diagnose and fix problems
- **Product analytics events and identifiers** — collected through PostHog (for example, screens viewed and features used), associated with a user identifier

---

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- **Provide and operate** the Nuzzle app, including your personalized home feed, breed-community feeds, and notifications
- **Authenticate you** and maintain your session securely
- **Display your profile and your dogs' profiles** to other users in the community
- **Enable social features** — posts, comments, reactions, meetup RSVPs, dog-to-dog interaction logs, and place vibes
- **Power Dog Spots** — verify location proximity for place check-ins and show which dogs are currently present at a Dog Spot
- **Power Dog Friendly Places** — use your location to surface nearby dog-welcoming businesses via the Google Places API
- **Enable guest browsing** — serve read-only content to users who have not created an account
- **Send in-app notifications** when someone comments on or reacts to your posts, RSVPs to your meetups, or logs a dog interaction involving your dog
- **Support search and discovery** — full-text search across posts and breed communities
- **Moderate content** — process reports on posts and comments and enforce our community guidelines
- **Improve the app** — analyze usage patterns and fix bugs
- **Respond to support requests** and communicate with you about your account

---

## 4. How We Share Your Information

### 4.1 With Other Nuzzle Users

Nuzzle is a social community. The following information is visible to other users by default:

- Your display name, profile photo, and city
- Your dogs' names, breeds, photos, and public compatibility profiles
- Posts, comments, and reactions you create
- Meetups you host and RSVPs you submit
- Dog interaction logs you record

### 4.2 Service Providers

We share information with third-party service providers who process it on our behalf, under their own privacy and security terms:

- **Supabase** — hosts our database, authentication services, and file storage (profile photos, dog photos, and post images).
- **Google** — we use the Google Places API to look up and display nearby dog-friendly businesses in the Dog Friendly Places feature. When you use that feature, your device location may be sent to Google to retrieve nearby place results, subject to Google's Privacy Policy.
- **PostHog** — product analytics, hosted in the United States. We send usage events and a user identifier (and, for signed-in users, your email address and sign-in provider) to PostHog to understand how features are used and to improve the app.
- **Sentry** — crash reporting, error monitoring, and performance diagnostics.
- **Expo** — push notification delivery. We register a device push token with the Expo push notification service so we can send you push notifications.

We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

### 4.3 Apple and Google Sign In

If you use Sign in with Apple or Google, the provider shares limited authentication information with us as described in their privacy policy. We receive only what is necessary to create and maintain your account.

### 4.4 Legal Requirements

We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Nuzzle, our users, or others.

### 4.5 Business Transfers

If Nuzzle is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via in-app notice or email before your information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

---

## 5. Photos and Media

Photos you upload (profile photos, dog photos, and post images) are stored in Supabase Storage and are accessible via public URLs to display content within the app. Do not upload photos containing sensitive personal information beyond what you intend to share with the Nuzzle community.

---

## 6. Location Data

Location access is requested on-device only when you use a proximity-dependent feature:

- **Place check-ins** — we use your location to confirm you are near a Dog Spot before allowing a check-in. We do not store your precise GPS coordinates beyond what is needed to complete the check-in.
- **Nearby Dog Spot alerts** — when enabled, the home feed periodically checks your proximity to a nearby Dog Spot to display an optional check-in prompt. This check is performed on-device and is not used for any other purpose.
- **Dog Friendly Places discovery** — your location is used to query the Google Places API for nearby dog-welcoming businesses. We do not store your coordinates for this query beyond the immediate request.

We do not continuously track your location, and we do not share your precise location with other users. You can revoke location permission at any time via your device settings.

---

## 7. Notifications

Nuzzle sends both in-app notifications and push notifications to keep you informed about community activity relevant to you — for example, comments and reactions on your posts, meetup RSVPs, dog interactions involving your dog, and relevant community activity. To deliver push notifications, we register a push token for your device with the Expo push notification service. You can turn push notifications on or off at any time through your device's system settings, and you may decline the notification permission when first prompted.

---

## 8. Data Retention

We retain your account information and content for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we will delete or anonymize your personal information within a reasonable period, except where we are required to retain it for legal or legitimate business purposes (e.g., to resolve disputes or comply with legal obligations).

Content you have posted that was reacted to or commented on by others may be anonymized rather than deleted in order to preserve the integrity of community discussions.

---

## 9. Children's Privacy

Nuzzle is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete that information.

---

## 10. Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information, including:

- **Row-level security** on our database to ensure users can only access data they are permitted to see
- **Encrypted connections** (TLS/HTTPS) for all data in transit
- **Supabase Auth** with secure session management and token handling

No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 11. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your personal information:

- **Access** — request a copy of the personal information we hold about you
- **Correction** — update or correct inaccurate information via your profile settings
- **Deletion** — request deletion of your account and associated personal data
- **Portability** — request a portable copy of your data
- **Withdraw consent** — revoke location access at any time via your device settings; this will disable Dog Spot check-ins, nearby-place alerts, and Dog Friendly Places proximity discovery

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information in Section 13.

### California Residents (CCPA)

If you are a California resident, you have the right to know what personal information we collect and how it is used, the right to delete your personal information, and the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information. We do not sell personal information.

### European / UK Residents (GDPR / UK GDPR)

If you are located in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, our legal bases for processing your information are: **performance of a contract** (providing the Nuzzle service), **legitimate interests** (improving the app, preventing fraud), and **consent** (location access). You may contact us to exercise your data subject rights at any time.

---

## 12. Third-Party Links and Services

The app may link to third-party content or services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third parties, and we are not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you use.

## Welcome to the Nuzzle Community

Nuzzle exists to bring dog lovers together — to share stories, ask questions, celebrate breeds, organize meetups, and build a real community around the dogs in our lives. To keep this a safe, welcoming, and genuinely useful place for everyone (humans and dogs alike), we ask all members to follow these guidelines.

Violations may result in content removal, account suspension, or a permanent ban, depending on severity. These guidelines apply to all content and behavior on Nuzzle, including posts, comments, reactions, dog profiles, meetup listings, direct interactions, and check-ins.

---

## 1. Be Kind and Respectful

Nuzzle is a community built on a shared love of dogs. Treat every member the way you'd want to be treated at a dog park.

**Do:**
- Engage with curiosity and openness, even when you disagree
- Offer constructive feedback and helpful corrections
- Celebrate each other's dogs and milestones

**Don't:**
- Insult, demean, or belittle other members or their dogs
- Attack someone personally because you disagree with their opinion
- Use sarcasm or passive-aggression to undermine others
- Pile on or gang up on a single user

> Healthy debate is welcome. Personal attacks are not.

---

## 2. Keep It About Dogs

Nuzzle is a dog community, not a general social network or political forum.

**Do:**
- Post content relevant to dogs, breeds, dog care, meetups, Dog Spots, or Dog Friendly Places
- Share related lifestyle content that naturally involves your dog(s)

**Don't:**
- Post off-topic political, religious, or unrelated commercial content
- Use Nuzzle as a platform to promote unrelated businesses, campaigns, or causes
- Redirect discussions away from dogs and into divisive unrelated topics

---

## 3. Be Honest and Authentic

Trust is the foundation of a useful community.

**Do:**
- Post genuine questions, real experiences, and accurate information
- Clearly label opinions as opinions when sharing advice
- Represent your dog's temperament and compatibility accurately — other dogs and their owners are counting on it

**Don't:**
- Create fake accounts or impersonate other users
- Post misleading information presented as fact
- Fabricate dog interaction logs, place check-ins, or place reviews (vibes)
- Log dog interactions on behalf of another owner without their knowledge or consent

---

## 4. Health and Veterinary Topics

Questions about dog health are some of the most important discussions on Nuzzle. Handle them responsibly.

**Do:**
- Share your own experiences and what worked for your dog
- Recommend consulting a licensed veterinarian for health concerns
- Acknowledge the limits of your knowledge when giving advice

**Don't:**
- Present yourself as a veterinary professional if you are not
- Discourage someone from seeking veterinary care
- Share unverified or dangerous health advice (e.g., harmful home remedies)
- Diagnose another user's dog

> A health disclaimer is automatically shown on health-tagged posts as a reminder that content on Nuzzle is not veterinary advice.

---

## 5. Photos and Media

Photos make Nuzzle come alive. Keep them appropriate and honest.

**Do:**
- Share clear, well-lit photos of your dog(s)
- Include relevant context (breed, age, location, event) when it adds value

**Don't:**
- Post sexually explicit, graphic, or disturbing imagery
- Post photos of other people's dogs or children without permission
- Use stock photos or images you don't own as if they're your own
- Post images containing personal information (phone numbers, addresses, etc.)

---

## 6. No Hate, Discrimination, or Harassment

Nuzzle has zero tolerance for hate.

**Prohibited:**
- Hate speech targeting any person or group based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected characteristic
- Harassment, threats, or intimidation of any user
- Coordinated campaigns to report, downvote, or target a specific user
- Content that sexualizes or demeans any person

This includes content in posts, comments, dog profile descriptions, meetup listings, and any other user-generated field.

---

## 7. No Spam or Self-Promotion

Keep Nuzzle's feeds useful and authentic.

**Prohibited:**
- Repetitive or unsolicited promotional posts for products, services, or external links
- Using Nuzzle primarily or exclusively to drive traffic to an external site, store, or social account
- Automated posting, bot accounts, or scripted activity
- Comment sections used for commercial solicitation

> Sharing a product or resource you genuinely found helpful, in the relevant context, is fine. Turning Nuzzle into an ad channel is not.

---

## 8. No Animal Cruelty or Neglect

This is non-negotiable.

**Prohibited:**
- Any content depicting, glorifying, encouraging, or joking about cruelty, abuse, neglect, or harm toward any animal
- Content promoting or organizing animal fighting
- Sharing videos or images of animals in distress for entertainment

Violations of this rule will result in immediate and permanent account termination and may be reported to the appropriate authorities.

---

Nuzzle meetups are a highlight of the community. Make them safe and welcoming.

**Do:**
- Post accurate meetup details (location, time, what to expect, dog size/energy level guidance if relevant)
- Be welcoming to all compatible dogs and their owners who RSVP
- Cancel or update your meetup promptly if plans change

**Don't:**
- Use meetup listings to organize non-dog-related gatherings

---

## 10. Dog Spots and Dog Friendly Places

**Do:**

- Use place pages to harass or target specific businesses or their staff

> Nuzzle is not affiliated with any third-party business listed in Dog Friendly Places. Listings are sourced from Google Places and community contributions.

---

## 11. Dog Compatibility and Interaction Logs

Dog profiles include compatibility fields (e.g., play style, good with puppies/large/small dogs) to help owners make informed decisions about introductions.

**Do:**
- Fill out your dog's compatibility profile honestly
- Update it as your dog's temperament or needs change over time
- Log interactions accurately to help build a record of your dog's social history

**Don't:**
- Exaggerate your dog's friendliness or hide known aggression issues
- Log interactions that didn't happen or that the other dog's owner didn't consent to
- Use interaction logs to tag or follow users who have asked not to be contacted

---

## 12. Reporting and Moderation

If you see content that violates these guidelines, please report it. Every report helps keep the community safe.

**How to report:**
- Use the in-app report button on any post or comment
- Reports are reviewed by our moderation team

**What happens after a report:**
- Content may be removed if it violates these guidelines
- Repeat or serious violators may be suspended or permanently banned
- False or bad-faith reports (weaponizing the report system against users you dislike) are themselves a violation of these guidelines

We aim to be fair, consistent, and transparent in our moderation decisions.

---

## 13. Enforcement

Depending on the nature and severity of a violation, we may take the following actions:

| Severity | Example | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Minor | Off-topic post, mild spam | Content removed, warning |
| Moderate | Repeated spam, disrespectful comments | Temporary suspension |
| Serious | Harassment campaign, impersonation | Permanent ban |
| Critical | Animal cruelty, threats of violence | Immediate permanent ban; possible law enforcement referral |

We reserve the right to make enforcement decisions at our discretion. If you believe a moderation action was taken in error, you may contact us at **hello@nuzzleapp.io** to appeal.

---

## The Spirit of These Guidelines

Rules can only go so far. The real spirit of Nuzzle is this: **be the kind of community member whose dog you'd want to meet at the park.** Show up with generosity, curiosity, and good faith — and bring your dog next time.
